This project was made during a short Hackathon at Wild Code School: 

- Topic of the Hackathon:  Travel
- Time: 36hrs

Ideation: Our idea was to create an app for travelers to discover small "bouibouis" (small & typical places where locals are often going). The app is location-based and gives a list of close by restaurants, bars & more that the user can choose via a Tinder style list. In our concept, the places available in the app are validated by the team base on certain criterias.
